# issue with A3
remember to solve this [bug](https://lovellbrian.github.io/2023/05/16/Bug.html) from Professor Brian remind
## three steps needed to do 

**first step is**
>We’ll start by getting URLs from a search: we fix the cell by replacing it with:
>
>`from fastbook import search_images_ddg
  urls = search_images_ddg('bird photos', max_images=1)
  urls[0]`
  
  **Second step is** 
  >“forest photos”: we fix the cell by replacing it with:
  >
  >`download_url(search_images_ddg('forest photos', max_images=1)[0], 'forest.jpg', show_progress=False)
Image.open('forest.jpg').to_thumb(256,256)`

**Third step is**
>grab 200 examples of each of “bird” and “forest” photos, and save each group of photos to a different folder: by replacing it with:
>
>`searches = 'forest','bird'
>path = Path('bird_or_not')
>from time import sleep
>for o in searches:
    dest = (path/o)
    dest.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)
    download_images(dest, urls=search_images_ddg(f'{o} photo'))
    sleep(10)  # Pause between searches to avoid over-loading server
    download_images(dest, urls=search_images_ddg(f'{o} sun photo'))
    sleep(10)
    download_images(dest, urls=search_images_ddg(f'{o} shade photo'))
    sleep(10)
    resize_images(path/o, max_size=400, dest=path/o)`
this is important
